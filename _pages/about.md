I am a recent Ph.D. graduate in Computing from the [SPIKE Research Group](https://spike.doc.ic.ac.uk/) at [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/), where I was advised by [Alessandra Russo](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/a.russo), [Krysia Broda](https://wp.doc.ic.ac.uk/kb/), [Mark Law](https://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~ml1909/) and [Anders Jonsson](https://www.upf.edu/web/anders-jonsson). My research focused on the learning and exploitation of (hierarchies of) finite-state machines in reinforcement learning, using them as a means for task decomposition and temporal abstraction.

During my Ph.D. studies I interned at [InstaDeep](https://www.instadeep.com/), where I worked on solving combinatorial optimization problems using reinforcement learning. Before starting my Ph.D., I was a research assistant in the [Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Group](https://www.upf.edu/web/ai-ml/) at [Universitat Pompeu Fabra](https://www.upf.edu/), where I worked on enabling action concurrency in multiagent planning and temporal planning.
