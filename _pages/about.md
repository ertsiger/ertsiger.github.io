I am a final year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the [SPIKE Research Group](https://spike.doc.ic.ac.uk/) @ [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/) advised by [Alessandra Russo](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/a.russo) and [Krysia Broda](https://wp.doc.ic.ac.uk/kb/). I have a bachelor's degree in Computer Science and a master's degree in Intelligent Interactive Systems, both from [Universitat Pompeu Fabra](https://www.upf.edu/).

During my Ph.D., I have worked on the learning and exploitation of (hierarchies of) finite-state machines in reinforcement learning, using them as a means for task decomposition and temporal abstraction.

Previously, I interned at [InstaDeep](https://www.instadeep.com/), where I worked on solving combinatorial optimization problems using reinforcement learning under the supervision of Tom Barrett. Before starting my Ph.D., I was a research assistant in the [Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Group](https://www.upf.edu/web/ai-ml/) @ [Universitat Pompeu Fabra](https://www.upf.edu/) under the supervision of [Anders Jonsson](https://www.upf.edu/web/anders-jonsson), where I worked on enabling action concurrency in multiagent planning and temporal planning. I also have experience as a software engineer at [Keonn Technologies](https://keonn.com/).
